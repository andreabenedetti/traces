        <h2>A data-driven timelapse re-enacting the Apps Privacy Report</h2>
        <p>In “Transient data, impermanent access”, a data-driven timelapse (data-lapse) collects and re-enacts data from <b>iOS’s App Privacy Report</b>, an interactive overview of apps and the services they accessed in the last seven days. <b>Camera, photos, contacts, microphone, media library, and location:</b> these are the sensors and services that applications openly ask access to.</p>
        
        <p>Condensing <b>24 hours in 5 minutes</b>, the data-lapse reconstructs the usage of a smartphone from data that is not readily available to the user, revealing how much unseen information we produce by just opening an app.</p>
        
        <p>“Transient Data, Impermanent Access” provides access to data that is typically observed synoptically within a report, instead focusing on re-examining the production of such data.
          Dashboard-like overviews sacrifice this aspect, offering quantitative summaries that do not consider the situatedness of this specific data production.</p>
          
          <p>Additionally, the experience reveals <b>the impermanence of access to this type of information.</b> The data used to create the data-lapse is available to the user for only the last seven days, leaving older information either inaccessible or erased. Furthermore, when extracted from the smartphone—which reveals additional details within the dataset—it is encoded in a format that requires technical expertise to open and interpret.</p>
          
          <p><b>“Transient Data, Impermanent Access” argues that formally recognizing the existence of data does not necessarily imply proper visibility or presence.</b></p>
